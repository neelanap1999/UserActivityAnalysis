# UserActivityAnalysis

I have used Horizontal and Natural Visibility graphs to perform feature extraction on the timeseries data of accelerometer data in x, y, and z axis. The data is of 15 subjects who perform 4 activities: Walking, Running, Climbing up, Climbing Down. The sensors are located on 8 different parts of the body.
I also have used permutation entropy vs complexity so we can segregate the activities on the Complexity entropy causality plane for classifying random time series data.
